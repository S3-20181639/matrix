This module implements a linear algebra (matrix) class.

The algorithms in this module are not necessarily the fastest
possible or memory efficient.  Some optimizations have been
made, hoever.

Limitations
-----------
  -  supports only dense matrices

  -  not the most memory efficient algorithms (returns new
     matrices rather than performing operations in place)
